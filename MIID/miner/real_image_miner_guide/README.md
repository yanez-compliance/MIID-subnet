# Real Screen-Replay Photo Submission

This folder is where you submit a **real, physical photograph** — not an
AI-generated one — of the daily seed image displayed on a real screen. This
is completely **optional** and is not required every round. There is **no
daily limit** — submit as many different real captures as you want, as
often as you like. The only hard rule is: **never submit a duplicate**
(the same capture/photos again) — that's filtered out and penalised. It's
also fine to skip this entirely, or only submit occasionally.

## TL;DR

1. Take TWO photos of the SAME capture, from two different angles/positions:
   display today's daily seed image on a real screen (phone, tablet, laptop,
   monitor, or TV) and photograph it twice with a **different** physical
   camera (no screenshots). Two angles of one capture, not two unrelated
   photos.
2. Drop both photo files into `inbox/` (this folder) — exactly 2 images.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python MIID/miner/real_image_miner_guide/submit_real_photo.py
   ```
4. Answer the few questions it asks you (camera used, which device you
   photographed, which visual cues are visible). That's it — nothing else to
   do. Your miner process picks it up automatically and submits both photos
   as one submission the next time a validator queries you.
5. Want to submit again? Take a brand-new pair of photos and re-run the
   script — as many times as you like, whenever you're ready. Just make sure
   each pair is a genuinely new capture, never the same photos reused.

You do **not** need to restart your miner. `neurons/miner.py` checks
`screen_replay.json` on every incoming validator request, so as soon as the
script above finishes, the very next query will submit your photo.

## How it works under the hood

- `submit_real_photo.py` finds the two images you placed in `inbox/`, moves
  them into `staged/` (so `inbox/` is free for next time), and rewrites
  `screen_replay.json` with both photos' local paths + your answers, ending
  with `"ready": true`. It does **not** upload anything to S3 itself —
  that only happens once, below, at the real submission step.
- Your always-running miner process (`neurons/miner.py`) checks
  `screen_replay.json` every time it handles a validator request. When it
  sees `"ready": true`, it:
  1. Reads both photos from `photo_path` and `photo_path_2`.
  2. Encrypts each with drand timelock (same as every other submission).
  3. Uploads both **encrypted** photos to the real S3 submissions path (the
     only S3 uploads in this whole flow).
  4. Sends both references, as one submission, to the validator that
     queried it.
  5. Resets `screen_replay.json` back to a blank, `"ready": false` state so
     it won't accidentally resubmit the same capture again. You're free to
     queue up a brand-new capture right away.
- If `"ready"` is `false` (the normal, default state), the miner does
  nothing extra — this is expected most rounds. It's optional either way.

## `screen_replay.json` fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ready` | Set to `true` by `submit_real_photo.py` when a capture is queued. The miner flips it back to `false` after submitting. **You shouldn't normally need to edit this by hand.** |
| `photo_path` | Absolute path to the staged photo file (angle 1). |
| `photo_path_2` | Absolute path to the staged photo file (angle 2 — a different angle of the same capture). |
| `date` | Capture date, `YYYY-MM-DD` (UTC). Defaults to today. |
| `camera_used` | The camera/phone you used to take the photos, e.g. `"iPhone 15 Pro"`. |
| `device_photographed` | Which device displayed the seed image: one of `phone`, `tablet`, `laptop`, `monitor`, `tv`. |
| `moire_pixel_grid` | `true`/`false` — is a moiré/pixel-grid interference pattern visible? |
| `screen_glare_hotspots` | `true`/`false` — are specular glare hotspots visible? |
| `perspective_keystone_distortion` | `true`/`false` — is there off-angle/keystone distortion? |
| `gamma_contrast_shift` | `true`/`false` — is there a colour/brightness shift typical of a display capture? |
| `edge_crop_cues` | `true`/`false` — are screen borders/bezel/cropping visible? |

Report the cue checklist honestly — reviewers verify it, and a real photo
may legitimately show anywhere from 0 to 5 of these cues.

## Rules / good to know

- **No daily limit — send as many captures as you want.** Submit as often as
  you like; there's no cap on how many real screen-replay submissions you
  send.
- **Never submit a duplicate.** Every submission must be a genuinely new
  capture. Re-running the script on the same photos, or reusing photos from
  a previous submission, will be detected and penalised.
- **Each submission needs exactly TWO photos** — two different angles of the
  *same* capture, not one photo and not two unrelated photos. This is basic
  proof it's a real physical photo, not a single static image reused twice.
- It's a **real physical photo**, not a screenshot and not AI-generated. Do
  not use FLUX or any generator for this — that defeats the purpose.
- `inbox/` must contain exactly 2 images when you run the script — the
  script errors out if it finds fewer or more than 2, so there's no
  ambiguity about which pair belongs together.
- Skipping this entirely is fine. It's optional, not scored every round.

## Command-line flags (optional, for scripting/automation)

You can skip all the interactive prompts by passing flags up front:

```bash
python MIID/miner/real_image_miner_guide/submit_real_photo.py \
  --camera "iPhone 15 Pro" \
  --device phone \
  --moire --glare
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--camera TEXT` | Camera/phone used to take the photo |
| `--device {phone,tablet,laptop,monitor,tv}` | Device the seed image was displayed on |
| `--date YYYY-MM-DD` | Capture date (defaults to today, UTC) |
| `--moire` / `--glare` / `--keystone` / `--gamma` / `--edge-crop` | Mark a visual cue as visible (omit if not visible) |
