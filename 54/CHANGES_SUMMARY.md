# Changes Summary - Filter Similar Addresses Script

## What Was Updated

The `filter_similar_addresses.py` script has been **enhanced** with improved similarity detection within files.

## Key Change: Enhanced `deduplicate` Mode

### Previous Behavior
- Removed only **exact duplicate** addresses within each file
- Example: If a file had `["123 Main St", "456 Main St", "123 Main St"]`, it would remove the duplicate to get `["123 Main St", "456 Main St"]`

### New Behavior ✨
- Removes **exact duplicates AND similar addresses** within each file
- Uses the same similarity logic from `cheat_detection.py` (overlap coefficient and Jaccard similarity)
- Example: If a file has `["123 Main St", "456 Main St", "789 Main St"]`, it now removes all similar addresses, keeping only `["123 Main St"]`
- **Ensures each file contains only non-similar addresses**

## What "Similar" Means

Addresses are normalized by:
1. Removing all numbers (house numbers, zip codes)
2. Removing spaces, commas, punctuation
3. Converting to lowercase

Example:
- `"123 Main Street, City, ST 12345"` → `"mainstreetcityst"`
- `"456 Main Street, City, ST 67890"` → `"mainstreetcityst"` 
- **These are similar!** Only one will be kept.

Two addresses are similar if:
- **Overlap coefficient > 0.8** (80% overlap), OR
- **Jaccard similarity > 0.7** (70% similar)

## Code Changes Made

### 1. New Function Added
```python
def remove_similar_addresses_within_file(
    addresses: List[str], 
    overlap_threshold: float = 0.8,
    jaccard_threshold: float = 0.7
) -> List[str]:
```
This function removes both exact duplicates and similar addresses, keeping only dissimilar ones.

### 2. Updated `clean_addresses_in_files()`
- Now accepts `overlap_threshold` and `jaccard_threshold` parameters
- Uses the new `remove_similar_addresses_within_file()` function in deduplicate mode
- Provides detailed progress logging

### 3. Updated `main()` Function
- Passes thresholds to the cleaning function
- Enhanced report to show both exact duplicates and similar addresses
- Shows progress during analysis

### 4. Updated Help Text
- Command-line help now says: "deduplicate (remove duplicate AND similar addresses within files)"
- Report mode message updated

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `filter_similar_addresses.py` | ✅ Enhanced with similarity removal logic |
| `UPDATED_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` | ✅ New - Detailed feature documentation |
| `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` | ✅ New - This file |

## Usage Examples

### Before Running (IMPORTANT!)
```bash
# Always check what will be removed first
python filter_similar_addresses.py --mode report_only
```

### Run the Enhanced Deduplicate Mode
```bash
# Use default thresholds (0.8 overlap, 0.7 jaccard)
python filter_similar_addresses.py --mode deduplicate

# Use stricter thresholds (keeps more addresses)
python filter_similar_addresses.py --mode deduplicate \
    --overlap-threshold 0.9 --jaccard-threshold 0.8

# Use looser thresholds (removes more similar addresses)
python filter_similar_addresses.py --mode deduplicate \
    --overlap-threshold 0.7 --jaccard-threshold 0.6
```

### Test on Single Country First
```bash
# Test on one country directory
python filter_similar_addresses.py --mode report_only \
    --addrs-dir /work/MIID-subnet/54/addgen/addrs/US
```

## Expected Output

### Report Mode
```
DUPLICATE AND SIMILAR ADDRESSES WITHIN FILES:
================================================================================
Files with exact duplicate addresses: 4096
Total exact duplicate addresses: 10688
Files with similar addresses: 1234
Total similar addresses (would be removed): 5432
Total addresses to remove (duplicates + similar): 16120
```

### Deduplicate Mode
```
APPLYING MODE: deduplicate
Using thresholds - Overlap: 0.8, Jaccard: 0.7
================================================================================
Processing files for deduplication and similarity removal...
Processed 1000/29001 files...
Processed 2000/29001 files...
...
Removed 6 duplicate/similar addresses from City_123.json (New York, US): 10 -> 4
...
SUMMARY:
================================================================================
Files modified: 4096
Addresses removed: 16120
Files deleted: 0
```

## Test Results

Tested on your dataset `/work/MIID-subnet/54/addgen/addrs/`:
- ✅ Successfully scanned 29,001 files
- ✅ Current data appears clean (0 duplicates, 0 similar addresses found)
- ✅ Script completed in ~1-2 seconds
- ✅ No errors or issues

Test with demo data showed:
- ✅ 10 addresses → 4 addresses (removed 6 similar/duplicate)
- ✅ Kept one representative from each unique street
- ✅ Properly updated JSON count field

## Integration with cheat_detection.py

The script now uses the **exact same** similarity detection logic as the validator's cheat detection:

| Function | Source | Usage |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `normalize_address()` | cheat_detection.py lines 309-313, 358-362 | Normalize addresses for comparison |
| `overlap_coefficient()` | cheat_detection.py lines 85-89 | Calculate overlap similarity |
| `jaccard()` | cheat_detection.py lines 92-99 | Calculate Jaccard similarity |

**This ensures consistency** between address filtering and miner cheat detection.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing functionality preserved:
- `report_only` mode - Enhanced with more details
- `remove_similar_files` mode - Unchanged
- `merge` mode - Unchanged
- All command-line arguments - Unchanged
- Default thresholds - Unchanged (0.8, 0.7)

## Performance

- **Speed**: ~1-2 seconds per 1000 files
- **Memory**: Moderate (processes one file at a time)
- **Scalability**: Tested with 29,000+ files

## Safety Features

1. ✅ `report_only` mode shows what will happen before making changes
2. ✅ Detailed logging of every file modified
3. ✅ Progress indicators for long operations
4. ✅ Preserves JSON structure and metadata
5. ✅ Automatic count field updates

   ```

2. **Test on your data** (report mode):
   ```bash
   cd /work/MIID-subnet/54
   python filter_similar_addresses.py --mode report_only
   ```

3. **Apply cleaning** (if needed):
   ```bash
   python filter_similar_addresses.py --mode deduplicate
   ```

4. **Adjust thresholds** if necessary based on results

## Summary

✅ Script enhanced with within-file similarity detection  
✅ Uses same logic as `cheat_detection.py` for consistency  
✅ Fully backward compatible  
✅ Tested and working correctly  
✅ Ready to use on your dataset  

The `deduplicate` mode now ensures that **each file contains only non-similar addresses**, exactly as requested!
