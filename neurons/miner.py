Name Variation Miner Module

This module implements a Bittensor miner that generates alternative spellings for names
using a local LLM (via Ollama). 
######### Ollama should be installed and running on the machine. ########
The miner receives requests from validators containing
a list of names and a query template, processes each name through the LLM, extracts
the variations from the LLM's response, and returns them to the validator.

The miner follows these steps:
1. Receive a request with names and a query template
2. For each name, query the LLM to generate variations
3. Process the LLM responses to extract clean variations
4. Return the variations to the validator

The processing logic handles different response formats from LLMs, including:
- Comma-separated lists
- Line-separated lists
- Space-separated lists with numbering

For debugging and analysis, the miner also saves:
- Raw LLM responses
- Processed variations in JSON format
- A pandas DataFrame with the variations

Each mining run is saved with a unique timestamp identifier to distinguish between
different runs and facilitate analysis of results over time.
